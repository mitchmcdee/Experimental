Staff:  Neil Bergmann &amp; Marcus Gallagher

NOTE:  For S1/2018 Please sign up to this project under Marcus Gallagher's project list

Description:

Machine Learning is a way of computing system design where the system learns by example, i.e. it trains itself of examples of system inputs and outputs.  For example, rather than trying to devise criteria that would distinguish between pictures of cats and dogs, a machine learning algorithm would devise its own internal criteria based on hundreds or thousands of labelled pictures of cats and dogs so that it could make correct decisions when it encounters new unlabelled pictures.

There are many different machine learning algorithms.  Each algorithm has a different sort of parametrised internal formula that it uses for decision making, and in each case "learning" involves determining good parameters for those internal formulas.

Machine learning algorithms have been well known for several decades, but the abundance of very large sets of online data has renewed interest in these algorithms.  Systems like on-line recommender systems, web-search ranking engines, speech recognition, and image understanding are all based on machine learning.

In order to promote interest and to identify solutions to  problems that are amenable to machine learning, there are a number of sites that offer open "challenge" problems.  Once registered, engineers can devise and submit potential solutions to commercial machine learning problems, and after a few months, the best solution is identified, and often a prize is awarded.

This challenge project is based around problems offered on the "Kaggle" website, where machine learning solutions, coded in either Python or R, compete to be the best.  As an added bonus, winners of kaggle challenges can win prizes of $100,000 or more.

This project consists of two phases:

1.  In semester 2/17, students will develop their expertise in machine learning algorithms, in relevant programming languages (Python and R and their relevant libraries), and work through relevant tutorial examples in Kaggle, or in a similar website.

2.  During semester 1/18, students will choose one or more open challenge problems on Kaggle or elsewhere (which close before the end of May 2018) and submit an entry, and evaluate their success in the challenge.  

3.  Although only submitting one final solution to Kaggle, students are expected to code and compare a selection of machine learning approaches, and to document these in their written thesis.

4.  Students who enrol in a #6 version of the project will be expected to submit solutions for 2 Kaggle challenge problems OR they should do 1 x Kaggle plus 1 x deep-learning network problem.




Pre-requisites:

Students will either need to have already completed COMP4702 (Machine Learning) OR CSSE3080 (S3/2015 - machine Learning)  OR complete suitable on-line courses in Machine Learning by September 2017.  Reasonable mathematical skills are an advantage.

Students will need to be competent and confident programmers in either Python or R, or be willing to learn these languages by September 2017.

The project should be suitable for undergraduate or coursework postgraduates from any discipline.</details><details><summary>Further Information:</summary>https://www.kaggle.com/</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Optimisation Super Project</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Neil William Bergmann</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>5</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Embedded Systems Group</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>AI/Cognitive ScienceComputational ScienceComputer SystemsSoftwareSystems Engineering</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over two semesters for BE,BE/ME,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc,MInfTech,MIDes students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>PLEASE SIGN UP TO THIS PROJECT UNDER MARCUS GALLAGHER'S LISTING, I WILL BE ASSISTING WITH SUPERVISION.

**Background**: Optimisation problems (e.g. minimize cost or error, maximize efficiency or profit) occur everywhere (science, engineering, industry, government) and there are a wide variety of algorithms that can be applied to these problems. In general, the optimization problem is intractable, unless certain assumptions can be made about the problem structure. Therefore in practice the aim is often to find as good a solution as possible given some amount of resources (e.g. computing time). **Aims**: The basic aim of this project is to use one (or more) optimisation algorithms to solve one (or more) problems. There is considerable flexibility in the choice of: (a) algorithm(s); (b) problems(s); (c) software implementation and (d) experimental evaluation that can be done. Each project would be expected to explore deeply at least one of (a) - (d). A non-exhaustive list of suggested algorithms, problems and software packages will be provided. **Project structure (year-long example)**: Background reading will be given to be covered in the first few weeks of the project. The remainder of Sem1 will be about achieving a "proof-of-concept" application of an algorithm to a (likely) simple/benchmark problem and producing some results. Semester 2 will then focus on a more detailed study.</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Passive Radar and Wireless Sensing</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Konstanty Bialkowski</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Microwave and Optical Communications</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>CommunicationsMicrowaves and RadarSignal and Image Processing</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>coms4105</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over two semesters for BE,MEngSc students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>Low cost USB DVB-T tuner chips (&lt;$15) provide a very low cost method of capturing data at up to 3.2MS/s. Several algorithms exist which can use data from multiple receivers to improve recognition of scattering objects as well as transmitting devices.

The combination of both of algorithms and the cheap hardware provides a low cost wireless sensing system.

See video link for an existing semi-synchronized bistatic passive radar project completed in Sem 1 2013. This project would extend this to multiple RTL-SDR either forming an array or using large geographic spacing between receivers.

Some applications of this can be to detect aircraft (as in the video link), using illuminators of opportunity, as well as 'through-the-wall-imaging' using Wifi or other indoor signals.  Lastly it can be used for traffic analysis and also source localization (to find where a transmitter is)</details><details><summary>Further Information:</summary>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9V73d0nF4A</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Biomedical Microwave Imaging/Detection</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Konstanty Bialkowski</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>4</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Microwave, Photonics and Communications</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>Biomedical EngineeringCommunicationsMicrowaves and Radar</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>coms4105, C/C++ Programming, embedded, microwave</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over two semesters for BE,MEngSc,MCompSc students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>Low-cost imaging systems which are safe and portable have the potential to revolutionize diagnosis of sickness and diseases. In fact most diseases if detected early enough, should be preventable. This is because of the high contrast at microwave frequencies of water which is present in strokes, tumors and several other conditions.

Microwave systems can be implemented using software-defined radio (SDR) techniques and use low cost receivers like power detector diodes and high speed ADCs. This project aims to develop a low-cost imaging system using several of these components as a proof of concept.

Students should consider taking coms4105 (or have already taken it) if taking this project.</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Farmbot Specialized Sensors: Super Project</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Konstanty Bialkowski</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>9</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Microwave, Photonics and Communications</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>5</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>Computational ScienceEmbedded SystemsMicrowaves and RadarRoboticsSignal and Image Processing</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6 over two semesters for BE,BE/ME,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MEngSc students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>The UQ farmbot project builds upon the 'Farmbot' open source project which automates farming via seeding, cultivatation and plant monitoring. Farmbot uses a CNC machine, combined with cameras and other sensors to perform its tasks. 

UQ farmbot is being deployed with solar power as its own power source, and tank water as its only water source. Farmbot is an experiment in automated agriculture under limited resources.

 This project will focus on using farmbot to ensure that healthy plants can be cultivated and monitored, using sufficient conservation of resources such as water and nutrients. This project will involve a set of core tasks including sensor movement and sensor data collection. This will allow familiarity with programming for the farmbot system, before integrating new sensors. Sensors could be used to monitor: the air, soil, or the fruit or plant itself. 

One such sensor could involve monitoring the electrical properties of the fruit.

The field of Mode Division Multiplexing (MDM) has become one of the hottest topics in optical communications over the past 5 years. In the radical new scheme of MDM, independent channels are sent in parallel using the same fibre by assigning each channel a unique spatial shape. This is similar to the way your wifi system increases its speed through the use of multiple spaced antennas. In this project students will work with computer-generated holograms to generate and detect these specially shaped beams for applications in MDM.</details><details><summary>Further Information:</summary>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlMqfDy4LQ0   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VRLTk730Hg</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Multi-dimensional imaging through multimode optical fibre</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Joel Carpenter</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>3</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Microwave, Photonics and Communications</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>Biomedical EngineeringPhotonics and Optical CommunicationsSignal and Image Processing</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,BE/ME students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>Multimode optical fibres are tiny conduits through which light can be guided and are often used in optical communications.

The problem is, an image that is put into 1 end of a multimode fibre will arrive completely scrambled at the other end, making it difficult to use as a probe. However, no information is actually lost inside the fibre and with the appropriate techniques, it is possible to recover the original image from its scrambled output. In this project, student will work with each dimension of light, amplitude, phase, polarisation, wavelength and space to view and project images through highly scrambling fibre.</details><details><summary>Further Information:</summary>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oehwib61puE</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Exotic states of light : optical vortices, nondiffracting beams and principal states.</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Joel Carpenter</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>4</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Microwave, Photonics and Communications</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>Photonics and Optical Communications</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,BE/ME students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>The way a light beam occupies space will define how it propagates and interacts with what it comes in contact with.

MR images in 3D, while providing a wealth of anatomical information, including bones and soft tissue, are difficult to analyse due to the presence of a large number of complex structures. Thus, extracting meaningful clinical information without human interaction is a challenging task. Developing such automatic methods are important in order to reduce human errors and the time taken by clinicians in completing mundane tasks, such as marking or delineating 3D images by hand, from hours to just a few minutes by utilising computers.

In this project, the student will develop novel algorithms to solve segmentation and detection problems for MR imaging that could possibly be deployed to MRI scanners and may eventually used for diagnostic purposes. The project will involve applying computer vision and machine learning techniques to MR image processing and analysis.</details><details><summary>Further Information:</summary>http://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/9654</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Curvature learning for biomedical imaging applications</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Shekhar Chandra</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>4</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Biomedical Engineering</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>AI/Cognitive ScienceBiomedical EngineeringComputational ScienceSignal and Image Processing</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>Python/C/C++, Machine Learning, PDEs, Physics</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over two semesters for BE,BE/ME,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc,MInfTech,MIDes students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, while an important non-invasive radiological modality for various clinical applications, are difficult to analyse due to the presence of a large number of complex structures. Thus, extracting meaningful clinical information without human interaction is a challenging task. The shape of bones and organs is one such particular type of clinical information that can be important for diagnosis and treatment, which can take hours of manual interpretation by a radiologist or clinician.

In this project, the student will apply machine learning techniques to identify keypoints on bone or organ surfaces based on curvature of surface data already available from previous projects involving the supervisor. The learning the key curvature components of these types of surfaces, it is hoped that the resulting keypoints on the surface will lead to simplifying problems such as surface registration and shape modelling. This work will have applications to analysing human joints and cartilage from MR images and shape analysis of human organs that may eventually be available in MRI scanners.

The quality of an MRI scan, which dictates how useful the scan will be to clinicians, is controlled by a number of key factors. One of the most important factors is the algorithm used to recover the object being imaged from the MR measurements.

Unfortunately, the probes also detect non-sample related magnetic fields, known as background noise, which deteriorate signal quality. The current approach of reducing background noise is to house the NMR instrument in a shielded environment. However, the enclosure is generally large, expensive to make and, as a consequence, the instrument becomes non-portable. In this work an alternative approach to noise reduction will be investigated, whereby additional probes are used to measure the background environment and use this information to improve signal quality produced by the sample. The existing method known as gradiometry uses a direct and close connection between sample signal probe and noise probe and has been shown to  be very  effective for noise reduction. The drawback is the lack of freedom afforded in probe positioning due to the bulkiness of the setup, which hampers the use of many signal probes near the sample. Thereby, such a system is an unlikely candidate for ultra-low field NMR. In this project this issue will be circumvented by detaching the noise probe from the sample probe. On one hand this will allow higher freedom in sample probe positioning and more space for additional sample probes. On the other hand, sample signal can be increased by reducing the distance between the coil used to generate prepolarization field by the NMR instrument and sample. The research goal will be achieved via probe implementation in an ultra-low field NMR instrument and by performing ultra-low field NMR experiments, the data from which will be post-processed and analysed.</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Understanding of crowd worker processes on a crowdsourcing platform</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Gianluca Demartini</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Data and Knowledge Engineering Group</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>Good programming skills and keen to work on research problems</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,BE/ME,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc,MInfTech,MIDes students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>This project involves running a study to understand how people trust, complete, continue or abandon tasks to work on in crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon MTurk.

Machine Learning is a way of computing system design where the system learns by example, i.e. it trains itself of examples of system inputs and outputs. For example, rather than trying to devise criteria that would distinguish between pictures of cats and dogs, a machine learning algorithm would devise its own internal criteria based on hundreds or thousands of labelled pictures of cats and dogs so that it could make correct decisions when it encounters new unlabelled pictures. There are many different machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm has a different sort of parametrised internal formula that it uses for decision making, and in each case "learning" involves determining good parameters for those internal formulas. Machine learning algorithms have been well known for several decades, but the abundance of very large sets of online data has renewed interest in these algorithms. Systems like on-line recommender systems, web-search ranking engines, speech recognition, and image understanding are all based on machine learning. In order to promote interest and to identify solutions to problems that are amenable to machine learning, there are a number of sites (e.g. Kaggle) that offer open "challenge" problems. Once registered, engineers can devise and submit potential solutions to commercial machine learning problems, and after a few months, the best solution is identified, and often a prize is awarded. 

This thesis project is based around the model of challenge problems as offered on Kaggle.  That is, the aim of your project would be to build a machine learning software system(s) and apply it to a problem(s) given by an available dataset(s).  The project consists of two phases: 

1. In Semester 1 of the project, students will develop their expertise in machine learning algorithms, in relevant programming languages (Python and R and their relevant libraries), and work through relevant tutorial/standard examples in Kaggle, or a similar source. 

2. During Semester 2 of the project, students will choose one or more open challenge problems on Kaggle or elsewhere.  If the problem is for a current challenge, you would be expected to submit an entry, and evaluate youir success in the challenge. 

3. Although only submitting one final solution to Kaggle (if applicable), students are expected to code and compare a selection of machine learning approaches, and to document these in their written thesis. 

4. Students who enrol in a #6 version of the project will be expected to submit solutions for 2 Kaggle challenge problems OR discuss with me to ensure the project is appropriately scoped. 

Pre-requisites: Students will either need to have already completed COMP4702 (Machine Learning) OR CSSE3080 (S3/2015 - machine Learning) OR complete suitable on-line courses and readings in Machine Learning during the first few weeks of your project. Reasonable mathematical, numerical computing and statistical skills are an advantage. Students will need to be competent and confident programmers in a suitable programming language (typical choices would be Python, R, or Matlab) or be willing to learn a language during the first few weeks of the project. The project should be suitable for undergraduate or coursework postgraduates from any discipline.</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Optimisation Super Project</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Marcus Reginald Gallagher</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>9</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Complex and Intelligent Systems Group</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>10</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>AI/Cognitive ScienceComputational ScienceComputer SystemsSoftware</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>All useful background: programming, algorithms and data structures, numerical methods, statistics, discrete and/or continuous maths, machine learning, AI, optimisation, operations research</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,BE/ME,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc,MInfTech,MIDes students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>**Background**: Optimisation problems (e.g. minimize cost or error, maximize efficiency or profit) occur everywhere (science, engineering, industry, government) and there are a wide variety of algorithms that can be applied to these problems.  In general, the optimization problem is intractable, unless certain assumptions can be made about the problem structure.  Therefore in practice the aim is often to find as good a solution as possible given some amount of resources (e.g. computing time).

**Aims**: The basic aim of this project is to use one (or more) optimisation algorithms to solve one (or more) problems.  There is considerable flexibility in the choice of: (a) algorithm(s); (b) problems(s); (c) software implementation and (d) experimental evaluation that can be done.  Each project would be expected to explore deeply at least one of (a) - (d).  A non-exhaustive list of suggested algorithms, problems and software packages will be provided.

**Project structure (year-long example)**: Background reading will be given to be covered in the first few weeks of the project.  The remainder of Sem1 will be about achieving a "proof-of-concept" application of an algorithm to a (likely) simple/benchmark problem and producing some results.  Semester 2 will then focus on a more detailed study.</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Techniques for dividing Australian households into clusters based upon economic indicators</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Mark Philip Griffin</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>5</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc,MIDes students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey is a large, longitudinal survey that is the only survey of its kind that is nationally representative.

Based on recent demands for specified applications, electrospinning faces an imminent paradigm shift owing to a rapidly rising proportion of international research focusing on the production of scaffolds with ordered fibre morphologies. This change is triggered by the innovative technique of using polymer melts instead of solutions as the latter faces major challenges which include a randomised accumulation of the fibres or toxicity due to remaining solvent within the fibres. It has been proven that melt electrospun scaffolds provide significantly enhanced material and structural properties based on the capability to deposit fibres in a highly controlled manner. This technique of depositing melt electrospun fibres in an ordered manner is referred to as direct writing and adds melt electrospinning (MES) to the field of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies. 

However, MES describes a multi-parametric process whose results are highly dependent on the process parameters and guidelines to gain enhanced stability over longer production periods for higher reproducibility remain unexplored. “…Attaining an understanding of the effect that instrument parameters have on the processing of melt electrospun fibers is one of the challenges facing the field today and in the future” Indeed, contemporary devices lack the possibility to automatically influence the fabrication process and in parallel capture the resulting state of the morphology of the fibre. 

Therefore, the raison d'être of this project is to identify the most significant system parameters and their inter-correlations in order to obtain a stable and predictable fabrication process. In order to achieve this overarching objective, a system will be developed which is geared towards achieving two sub-goals: control over the influence on the properties of the parameters during printing and a data collection system to analyse and derive rules for optimal parameter compositions. It is our expectation that the results will advance the field of melt electrospinning from being empirically‐driven to simulation‐driven. The project is built on the hypothesis that the combination of well-designed melt electrospinning system combined with an image-based monitoring system integrated with a sophisticated in process control software will allow the reproducible fabrication and high throughput of melt electrospun scaffolds.</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Container support in OpenBSD</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>David Gwynne</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>3</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>Computer Systems</details><details><summary>&amp;nnbsp;Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>COMP3301</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,BInfTech(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>This project would continue development of the work at http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=144617514431852&amp;w=2 to add container support to OpenBSD.

Subsequent work added custom predicates to work directly with paths and path conditions in order to take advantage of Parfait’s underlying path-sensitive dataflow framework, which demonstrated the ability to generate analyses on par with hand-written C++ analyses, with less than 10% of the code required.

The performance of the generated code for more complex Datalog however could be significantly improved, as only basic brute-force optimisations have been implemented.

For this project, we would like to start implementing some of the low-hanging fruit in terms of available optimisations, including simple pattern-match transformations, selective caching of intermediate results, and simplifications based on the data structure invariants.</details><details><summary>Further Information:</summary>http://www.corptech.com.au/index.php/component/ceed/projects/view?id=2365</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Social attention for a social robot</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Scott Christopher Heath</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>4</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Complex and Intelligent Systems Group</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>2</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>AI/Cognitive ScienceComputational ScienceElectronicsEmbedded SystemsRoboticsSignal and Image ProcessingSoftware</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4 over two semesters for BE,BE/ME,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc,MInfTech,MIDes students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>Opie is a child-sized, child-friendly social robot intended for studying child-robot interaction in contexts such as the school classroom, public events and psychology labs.

An in-pavement detection loop comprising a coil of wire is resonated to a specific frequency based on the typical inductance / capacitance relationship embodied in a Tank Circuit oscillator. When several (up to 32) of these loops are located in the road pavement and tuned to a similar frequency, energy can be cross coupled between the loops causing erroneous activity. The objective of this project is to develop a microprocessor based test instrument that will resonate a specific loop winding and measure all other loops within the site to identify is cross coupling of energy is occurring. The project is one of development and discovery as measurements will identify an acceptable level of energy which does not trigger erroneous events and a threshold level which is unacceptable.

At high fields however the stronger interaction between the radio-frequency (RF) fields and human tissues leads to distorted fields, heterogeneous image intensity and potentially dangerous levels of energy deposition. Advanced RF systems with independent and parallel channels connected to array antennas have recently be proposed. By driving these antennas with optimal signals in parallel (named parallel transmission pulses), uniform image intensity and safe energy can be obtained. This project aim to design and implement an user-friendly and versatile software GUI that can drive various (developed) algorithms to design RF pulse for in vivo scan.

UQx is building open source tools to process learner clickstream data and present visualisations to course stakeholders.

In this project, we aim to (1) design and develop new visualisations for the UQx learning analytics dashboard, and (2) develop machine learning algorithms to better understand learner’s behaviours taking online courses. The project deliverables include extensions to the open source UQx Dashboard project (https://github.com/UQ-UQx/dashboard_js).

The exploratory analysis will be used to:
●   Uncover learner behaviour patterns contributing to course success or dropout
●   Compare paced and self-paced offerings of a MOOC
●   Analyse self-regulated learning strategies
●   Evaluate the impact of learning design choices on learner behavior and collaborative course participation
●   Support the diverse learning needs of the digitally minded students of the 21st century.
●   Investigate how MOOC-like methodologies such as the use of peer reviews, automatic assessments, self-evaluation, and self-paced learning may be better utilised in on-campus education.</details><details><summary>Further Information:</summary>https://www.edx.org/school/uqx</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Investigating Patterns of Performance and Engagement in Large Classes</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Hassan Khosravi</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>3</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>2</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>Students taking this project are expected to have strong programming skills in one of the languages Python/Java/C/C++/R.

There is an increasing growth in the popularity of Video-on-Demand services in today’s mobile and digitally connected world. More and more video content is served direct to the users when they want to watch such content on multiple (fixed and mobile) devices. The current practice is for IPTV service producers to deploy content servers at several locations. These servers often store all the content in their very extensive libraries. As more and more content gets generated and as more and more users consume such video on demand content, the sizes of these libraries will make the current practice quite intractable. It will be impractical to maintain, update and store entire libraries at each location. Smart digital content placement models and methods are necessary. In this project, we wish to examine heuristic and exact mathematical methods for such problems. 

Requirements:
•   Some knowledge of (and interest in) operations research, scheduling, location theory
•   Some knowledge of mathematical modelling methods,
•   Some knowledge of (and interest in) of metaheuristic algorithms like simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimisation, etc
•   Programming in C, C++ or Java.</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Scheduling Franchise-Based Sports (Cricket) Tournaments</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Mohan Krishnamoorthy</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>3</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>Computational ScienceInformation Systems</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>operations research, heuristics, programming in c/c++</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,BE/ME,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc,MInfTech,MIDes students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>The Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Big Bash League (BBL) are franchise based tournaments for Twenty20 (T20) cricket. From a small base, the IPL has become one of the fastest growing tournaments (in terms of viewership and brand value) in the world of sport. Scheduling games in the IPL is quite complex. Teams play each other often within a very small tournament time window. Given that a T20 game takes about 3 hours to complete, there can be no more than two games per day, particularly given that the television company would like to maximise viewership and sequence the games (rather than have them run in parallel). Most weekdays, however, can (mostly) have one game at night. In this project, the student will develop a literature review and develop a heuristic algorithm for the IPL tournament scheduling. Solutions will be compared to the schedules in previous tournaments in terms of reduced travel (lesser player fatigue) and fairer revenue share (gate receipts and TV viewing) and should also be more fan-friendly.

Requirements:
•   Some knowledge of (and interest in) operations research, scheduling, mathematical modelling
•   Some knowledge of (and interest in) of metaheuristic algorithms like simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimisation, etc
•   Programming in C, C++ or Java.
•   It would help if the student had an interest in cricket!</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Modelling with Reduced Data</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Hanna Kurniawati</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>6</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>AI/Cognitive ScienceRoboticsSoftware</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>COMP3702 &amp;amp;amp;gt;= 6 and comfortable programming in Linux</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4 over one or two semesters for BE,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc,MIDes students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>Constructing Predictive Models is the essence of many (if not all) scientific endeavour.

In fact, reaching a relatively high level of diversity has become a key target that companies/organizations would like to achieve. However, very few tools are available to support companies in developing a pathway to achieve their diversity goal. This project is our first step in developing such computational tools.

In medical X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation is small compare to the size of the object (patient) such that the electromagnetic field that transmits through the object can be approximated by a straight line. However, when the wavelength of the electromagnetic field becomes comparable to the object (i.e using a lower excitation frequency or imaging a smaller object), diffraction phenomena dominates and solutions developed in X-ray CT no longer valid. Diffraction Tomography is thus required,


In this project, you are expected to gain physical insights about the problem and to implement the entire imaging problem in Matlab.

Background in electromagnetic field propagation is crucial for understanding the topic. Students with strong interest in computational science, signal processing and hands-on skills in Matlab are recommended. Knowledge in medical imaging (ELEC4601/7606) is preferred but not essential.

The amount of the reflection and transmission depends on the incident angle, polarisation and dielectric properties of the interface, which can be described using Fresnel's reflection and transmission coefficient. The reflection and transmission phenomena has been discussed in Part B in ELEC3100/7101. When an electromagnetic wave illuminates a multi-layer planar structure,  the amount of the reflected and transmitted wave is determined by the incident angle, polarisation and the material properties of all the layers. Such kind of multi-layer structures can be found in most photonics and microwave devices, e.g. OLED, lasers and frequency selective surfaces.  

In this thesis, you will implement a numerical model that accurately determines the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic wave under different planar layer structures. The objective is to study how the material properties of the layers will affect the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic wave. The project is relatively theoretical inclined. Students will a strong interest in electromagnetic theory with good competence in Matlab are welcome to apply.</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Investigation of Governor Deadband Setting and Its Implication on Power System Frequency Response</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Nahid-Al Masood</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Power and Energy Systems</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>Power</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>Sound knowledge in power system analysis (ELEC4300 as a prerequisite)</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4 over one or two semesters for BE,MEngSc students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>The main objectives of this thesis project are to investigate the governor deadband settings and their implications on power system frequency response.

Due to the success of emerging smart phone market, modern mobile communication devices tend to integrate multiple communication systems into a portable handset. The motivation behind this is iPhone for example: the 4.8 ounce handset includes UMTS/HSDPA, GSM/EDGE, WiFi, Bluetooth and GPS as well. Since each communication protocol may operate in a distinctive frequency band, instead of using several antennas, it is highly desirable to have one broadband or multi-band antenna to meet the antenna needs of multiple systems. On top of the multiple band operation requirement, the smart phone antenna also needs to be compact with a low proﬁle so that the antenna can be easily integrated with the circuit board and the handset enclosure. In addition, antenna has to have a reasonable radiation eﬃciency and a largely isotropic radiation pattern, the antenna must provide to ensure the connection quality.  Therefore, a compact planar monopole antenna has a wider input impedance bandwidth and can easily cope with the PCB fabrication process. Multiband operation can be facilitated via several techniques. To test the design, the antenna will be built in a simulation environments using different types of software such as HFSS, CST. Next antenna will be fabricated and tested to compare the simulation and experimental results.</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Microwave imaging techneques for biomedical applications</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Beadaa Jasem Mohammed</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>4</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Microwave, Photonics and Communications</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>2</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>Microwaves and Radar</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>comunication, microwaves , and basic electromagnetic courses</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,MEngSc students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>Cost effective, portable imaging systems that are safe and portable have the potential to be used as diagnosis tool for diseases.

However, Irvine's body has never been found, and many questions remain. Did Mallory and Irvine reach the summit? Did Irvine lose his grip on the mountain or slip into a crevasse? What path did they take on their ill-fated expedition? The punishing and inhospitable mountain has claimed many lives, and the dangerous of mounting an intensive search has stymied efforts to find answers. Now, with new drone technology, it is thought that a suitably designed rotorcraft could allow a team of investigators to scan the north face from the air and look down the fissures and gullies that cannot be safely reached on foot. Building such a system poses an extreme engineering challenge. The vehicle must fly at altitudes beyond the reach of conventional flying machines. It must operate in freezing cold conditions in bright sun. It must fly for long enough to make a useful survey, and it must be resilient to the winds and gusts blowing up from the foothills of the Himalayas. In this project, you will develop a high-altitude, high-efficiency rotor as part of a feasibility study for the expedition.

Although it is very useful to identify the source of inefficiencies in the building structure, it only addresses a part of the issue. Even in a highly efficient building, consumers with their unique behaviours can degrade the efficiency of energy usage. One example is using an appliance during on-peak hours or setting the HVAC setpoint to an unreasonable level. As the Internet-of-Things (IoT) is becoming widespread, more information about individual appliance's consumption is available. Therefore, it is the time to pinpoint the inefficiency in the consumers' behaviours. As one of the first effort on the topic, we intend to introduce "Greenness" factor for every household. To that end, we first design a "Greenness" map for every appliance in a household based on their physical and operational limitations, and relevant exogenous factors such as ambient temperature, type of day, the hour of the day, season, etc. Then, we quantify the "Greenness" of a household electricity consumption according to the data for every appliance. In the next step, we develop an aggregate "Greenness" map for every day of every year of the historical data to represent the overall efficiency of the consumer's behaviour in a household. Finally, we convert the aggregate "Greenness" map to a single "Greenness" factor for the household. The realised factors can be shown to the consumer in real-time to encourage them for more efficient consumption. It also can be used by the utility companies to reward/penalise their consumers accordingly.

It is connected to the Energex network in the area while it is feeding the Gatton campus load. Currently, the plant is operated based on some pre-defined rules which might be far from the optimal operating point. The goal of this project is to design an economic model predictive control (EMPC) for the plant considering PV generation, local load demand, feed-in tariff to the Energex grid, and the onsite diesel generator in the cost function. All physical and operational limitations of the plant will be considered in the optimisation problem in several constraints. A statistical framework will be developed for the expected values of load demand and PV generation in the optimisation problem. The problem formulation is a Mixed-Integer Programming type which has to be solved with an appropriate solver. In comparison with the baseline approach (i.e., existing rule-based approach), the ultimate goal is to show that the plant can be operated in a more economical way. To show the effectiveness of the proposed EMPC, simulation studies will be carried out for several weekend and weekdays of different seasons.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is currently at the top of the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies 2017 (https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-trends-in-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-2017) and this super project is exploring how a SmartHome could enhance a person's real-life experience. 

You will become a developer in a (pretend) start-up company that is taking advantage of the current hype around Internet of Things (IoT) devices in home automation. 

The SmartHome consists of two controller modules (Web-app and VirtualHome) and many individual in-home modules connected to the controller systems via WiFi to access a common database. All modules will be purchasable separately from a commercial website to be developed. Figure 1 (see link to PDF above) displays the overview of the system to be developed by up to 20 students.

Models allow terahertz properties of the material to be represented as a function of frequency.  Rapid, automatic, non-contact detection of complex materials remains a challenge with significant practical benefit. Sensing in the terahertz frequency range shows strong potential to overcome this challenge, in particular due to the unique spectral features of many materials in this frequency band.

In this project you will review existing mathematical models for heterogeneous dielectric materials and develop specific numerical models for a class of heterogeneous materials of practical importance.  These may include biological tissues, pharmaceuticals and plastic explosives.</details><details><summary>Further Information:</summary>http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/mpc</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Learning Analytics Dashboard Design</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Carl Reidsema</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Centre for eLearning Innovations and Partnerships in Science and Engineering</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>4</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>AI/Cognitive ScienceComputational ScienceeResearchHuman Computer InteractionInformation EnvironmentsInformation SystemsSoftware</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>Good programming and front end web skills</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,BE/ME,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc,MIDes students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>The Centre for eLearning Innovations and Partnerships in Science and Engineering (eLIPSE) is a new centre at UQ within the Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Information Technology (EAIT).

In 2014, eLIPSE collaborated with the University of California Berkeley, to trial a real-time group discussion environment developed to support chat-based peer learning in MOOCs. The tool facilitates chat-based guided small peer discussion in MOOCs around challenging problem / concept questions. Students enter the system and are given an exam/quiz question that they respond to and then are put into ad-hoc discussion groups with the goal of determining whether their responses are correct. This chat buffer is recorded and analysed for evidence of peer learning and conceptual understanding. Analysis of this data can help to ascertain whether and when:

1. collaborative discussion / peer instruction is occurring
2. collaborative discussion is helping with understanding
3. to best facilitate effective online collaborative learning online

Student performance on each quiz gives an indication of their level of understanding of the concept prior to the chat. Their post-chat responses and their responses to the related mid-semester questions can be used to ascertain learning gains for those who did the chat versus those who did not participate. Together these measures will give qualitative and quantitative understanding of the gains in learning as a result of the MOOCchat discussions. 

Students who select this research project may focus on the design and running of experiments to determine the effectiveness of the software in improving student engagement and performance of learning or can choose to improve the overall design of the software system to allow for administrator control or improvements to the user interface.</details><details><summary>Further Information:</summary>https://www.elipse.uq.edu.au/home</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Data Quality Management</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Shazia Wasim Sadiq</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Data and Knowledge Engineering Group</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>3</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>Information Systems</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>Databases and Programming skills</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MCompSc students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>A range of projects are available within the general topic of data and information quality.

Can we use vision (or other sensing -- eg induction or hall effect sensing) to track adult breathing?  

An initial direction is affine video tracking of features (natural, such as hair, or artificial, such as lines drawn using a wax pencil) on the chest of a patient.  By calculating and tracking the affine deformations of the lines between these features, we hope to recover the breathing rate (Hz) and a qualitative measure of breathing strength (nb, this could be extended via regression to prior test cases to be a quantitative measures such as air exchange volume).

(co supervised by A. Prof. Marius Portmann). 

Distributed (cloud) motion/route planning (e.g., Google Maps, Telerobotic medical operations) typically involves sharing initial and final states (origin and destination in the case of Google Maps) and thus may "leak" user privacy.    This problem also appears in various contexts, such as in Privacy preserving route planning [1-2].  The structure of motion planning problems [3] may well be suited to leverage results from this domain, particularly for cases where one needs to computing distance functions of routes and/or assess traffic (group-sourced) information in a private manner.

Note: This is separate from the process of communicating securely to the remote "solver" (i.e., Tor/Orbot, SSL, etc.)

While classically treated as an optimization problem and hence one with limited horizon, we need not let the complexity limit our grasp.  We may extend our horizons and explore this via the tools of probabilistic robotics.

REST interactions. There is a big move in the e-Health space towards the use of FHIR for exchanging data in the domain, with most of the focus on exchange between clinicians or institutions. There has been less focus on communicating with patients themselves. We would like a student to explore the development of some software that focuses on software for use by patients (perhaps for their own use, perhaps for communicating with their clinician). There is a lot of scope to choose a project topic - both technically (open choice of implementation platform), and in which part of FHIR or what kind of user/activity to focus on (diagnostic reports, medications/prescriptions, etc).

However, due to the number of different codes (~500,000 in SNOMED CT) this leads to sparse data and makes analytics and reporting difficult. The project will focus on designing and implementing a web application that allows the construction and visualisation of aggregation categories that group sets of codes, identified using FHIR ValueSets, for reporting and analytic tasks.  The initial focus would be on supporting the query-based ​selection of codes for distinct aggregation categories. This project would use the new HL7 FHIR standard, and exploit CSIRO’s Ontoserver technology that underpins the National Clinical Terminology Service recently launched by the Australian Digital Health Agency. It carries the opportunity to influence and improve the FHIR standard itself. For extra credit, the student will also support visualisation of aggregate patient data using the SMART on FHIR.

These people were then followed up for around 10 years with incident cardiovascular disease and death recorded. See: https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs


This dataset thus has a wealth of data to study the relationship between measurements of physiology and long-term health outcomes. 


Previous work has used standard clinical metrics. In this series of thesis projects, students will have the opportunity to Invent new ways of analysing the raw physiological data; and/or using new data-science/machine learning approaches to use existing clinical metrics; and/or to validating previous techniques in a very large data-set. 


This project can be approached from a range of different perspectives:

- Biomedical signal processing

- Data science and machine learning

- Developing novel data visualisations

- Physiological modelling

- Physiological Control Systems

- Epidemiology and bio-statistics


Students working on this project will work with me to identify a specific topic in their area of interest. 


This/these project(s) have the potential to identify new information which can help to predict people who are likely to have good or bad health over the next decade. This could lead to the development of exciting new clinical tools which help to:

- Target the right treatment to the right patients; and conversely avoid the unnecessary treatment of individuals at low risk

- Better understand how particular disease (i.e. obstructive sleep apnoea) impacts the health of people in the long term.  


Students should have a strong technical background in Matlab or some other programming language, and some experience working with data. A biomedical science or health background is not required, but an interest in learning some material as part of the project is obviously highly desirable.</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Motion tracking to monitor head and torso posture during sleep</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Philip Ian Terrill</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>10</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Biomedical Engineering</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>Biomedical Engineering</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>ELEC3400, CSSE3010</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over two semesters for BE students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>Sleep apnoea is a common disease which is characterised by the repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep.

This project will investigate whether optical motion tracking (with or without accelerometry data) can be used to accurately resolve the head position relative to the torso. 

This equipment will ultimately allow posture to be measured; and ultimately identify individuals in whom head posture significant influences their disease.

Thus, the terminals will establish a mobile communication hub through a remote satellite, which is independent of any terrestrial networks, enabling the delivery of high-speed voice, data and video traffic. With the recent developments in which Google started a project of launching many moving low-orbit satellites (not stationary) to provide reliable broadband telecommunication services worldwide, there is a need for a low-cost reconfigurable antenna that can track those moving satellites. It is expected that the market for such an antenna subsystem is huge.</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Compact phase array design for wireless power transmission</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Yifan Wang</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>2</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>2</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>Photonics and Optical CommunicationsPower</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc,MIDes students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>In today’s connected and technologically advanced world, consumers are placing increasingly higher demands on their electronics devices, with an emphasis on portable electronics devices such as smartphones, tablets, and the emerging internet of things.

Instrumentation and analysis of biosignals enables clinicians to make reliable and convenient measurements of cardiovascular and respiratory function. This has transformed many facets of medicine over recent decades. In this project students will develop the next-generation of cardio respiratory monitoring systems. 
Students enrolled in this project will be tasked with designing and professionally constructing an instrument for measuring and/or analysing at least one modality of cardiovascular or respiratory function. This refers to monitoring of the electrocardiograph (ECG), respiratory rate and effort and pulse wave velocity. Not all modes are required and additional monitoring modes may be considered after consultation. Students will have freedom to then further develop the utility of their instrument. Suggestions include developing:
-   The most compact and least intrusive instrument for monitoring health
-   The instrument with the longest operational life (i.e. without changing battery) for extended recordings.
-   The cheapest disposable instrument
-   The best integrated system for recording multiple different physiological channels
-   A system targeted at recording information for diagnosing or monitoring a particular disease
-   The best embedded signals processing system for the automated signals analysis in a particular clinical application
-   The biomedical signals-processing, physiological monitoring or machine learning system for the automated diagnosis, monitoring or phenotyping. Retrospective data is available in a number of clinical areas to facilitate. 
-   A system to integrate with consumer electronics such as a smart-phone
