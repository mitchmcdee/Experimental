Machine Learning is a way of computing system design where the system learns by example, i.e. it trains itself of examples of system inputs and outputs. For example, rather than trying to devise criteria that would distinguish between pictures of cats and dogs, a machine learning algorithm would devise its own internal criteria based on hundreds or thousands of labelled pictures of cats and dogs so that it could make correct decisions when it encounters new unlabelled pictures. There are many different machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm has a different sort of parametrised internal formula that it uses for decision making, and in each case "learning" involves determining good parameters for those internal formulas. Machine learning algorithms have been well known for several decades, but the abundance of very large sets of online data has renewed interest in these algorithms. Systems like on-line recommender systems, web-search ranking engines, speech recognition, and image understanding are all based on machine learning. In order to promote interest and to identify solutions to problems that are amenable to machine learning, there are a number of sites (e.g. Kaggle) that offer open "challenge" problems. Once registered, engineers can devise and submit potential solutions to commercial machine learning problems, and after a few months, the best solution is identified, and often a prize is awarded. 

This thesis project is based around the model of challenge problems as offered on Kaggle.  That is, the aim of your project would be to build a machine learning software system(s) and apply it to a problem(s) given by an available dataset(s).  The project consists of two phases: 

1. In Semester 1 of the project, students will develop their expertise in machine learning algorithms, in relevant programming languages (Python and R and their relevant libraries), and work through relevant tutorial/standard examples in Kaggle, or a similar source. 

2. During Semester 2 of the project, students will choose one or more open challenge problems on Kaggle or elsewhere.  If the problem is for a current challenge, you would be expected to submit an entry, and evaluate youir success in the challenge. 

3. Although only submitting one final solution to Kaggle (if applicable), students are expected to code and compare a selection of machine learning approaches, and to document these in their written thesis. 

4. Students who enrol in a #6 version of the project will be expected to submit solutions for 2 Kaggle challenge problems OR discuss with me to ensure the project is appropriately scoped. 

Pre-requisites: Students will either need to have already completed COMP4702 (Machine Learning) OR CSSE3080 (S3/2015 - machine Learning) OR complete suitable on-line courses and readings in Machine Learning during the first few weeks of your project. Reasonable mathematical, numerical computing and statistical skills are an advantage. Students will need to be competent and confident programmers in a suitable programming language (typical choices would be Python, R, or Matlab) or be willing to learn a language during the first few weeks of the project. The project should be suitable for undergraduate or coursework postgraduates from any discipline.</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Optimisation Super Project</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Marcus Reginald Gallagher</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>9</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Complex and Intelligent Systems Group</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>10</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>AI/Cognitive ScienceComputational ScienceComputer SystemsSoftware</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>All useful background: programming, algorithms and data structures, numerical methods, statistics, discrete and/or continuous maths, machine learning, AI, optimisation, operations research</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,BE/ME,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc,MInfTech,MIDes students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>**Background**: Optimisation problems (e.g. minimize cost or error, maximize efficiency or profit) occur everywhere (science, engineering, industry, government) and there are a wide variety of algorithms that can be applied to these problems.  In general, the optimization problem is intractable, unless certain assumptions can be made about the problem structure.  Therefore in practice the aim is often to find as good a solution as possible given some amount of resources (e.g. computing time).

**Aims**: The basic aim of this project is to use one (or more) optimisation algorithms to solve one (or more) problems.  There is considerable flexibility in the choice of: (a) algorithm(s); (b) problems(s); (c) software implementation and (d) experimental evaluation that can be done.  Each project would be expected to explore deeply at least one of (a) - (d).  A non-exhaustive list of suggested algorithms, problems and software packages will be provided.

**Project structure (year-long example)**: Background reading will be given to be covered in the first few weeks of the project.  The remainder of Sem1 will be about achieving a "proof-of-concept" application of an algorithm to a (likely) simple/benchmark problem and producing some results.  Semester 2 will then focus on a more detailed study.</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Website/database design for healthcare</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Mark Philip Griffin</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>7</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>2</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>Human Computer InteractionInformation SystemsSoftware</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc,MIDes students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>A robust healthcare system is only possible through the support of a dedicated patient information system.

Subsequent work added custom predicates to work directly with paths and path conditions in order to take advantage of Parfait’s underlying path-sensitive dataflow framework, which demonstrated the ability to generate analyses on par with hand-written C++ analyses, with less than 10% of the code required.

The performance of the generated code for more complex Datalog however could be significantly improved, as only basic brute-force optimisations have been implemented.

For this project, we would like to start implementing some of the low-hanging fruit in terms of available optimisations, including simple pattern-match transformations, selective caching of intermediate results, and simplifications based on the data structure invariants.</details><details><summary>Further Information:</summary>http://www.corptech.com.au/index.php/component/ceed/projects/view?id=2365</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Developing a steep terrain controller for legged robots</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Navinda Kottege</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>CSIRO Queensland Centre for Advanced Technologies</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>RoboticsSoftware</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>GPA &gt; 5.5.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is currently at the top of the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies 2017 (https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-trends-in-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-2017) and this super project is exploring how a SmartHome could enhance a person's real-life experience. 

You will become a developer in a (pretend) start-up company that is taking advantage of the current hype around Internet of Things (IoT) devices in home automation. 

The SmartHome consists of two controller modules (Web-app and VirtualHome) and many individual in-home modules connected to the controller systems via WiFi to access a common database. All modules will be purchasable separately from a commercial website to be developed. Figure 1 (see link to PDF above) displays the overview of the system to be developed by up to 20 students.

Please refer to the link above for a detailed description of each of the 20 modules to be developed.</details><details><summary>Further Information:</summary>http://mythesis.alexpudmenzky.com/SmartHome_ProjectDescriptions.pdf</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Learning Analytics Dashboard Design</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Carl Reidsema</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Centre for eLearning Innovations and Partnerships in Science and Engineering</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>4</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>AI/Cognitive ScienceComputational ScienceeResearchHuman Computer InteractionInformation EnvironmentsInformation SystemsSoftware</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>Good programming and front end web skills</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,BE/ME,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc,MIDes students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>The Centre for eLearning Innovations and Partnerships in Science and Engineering (eLIPSE) is a new centre at UQ within the Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Information Technology (EAIT).

In 2014, eLIPSE collaborated with the University of California Berkeley, to trial a real-time group discussion environment developed to support chat-based peer learning in MOOCs. The tool facilitates chat-based guided small peer discussion in MOOCs around challenging problem / concept questions. Students enter the system and are given an exam/quiz question that they respond to and then are put into ad-hoc discussion groups with the goal of determining whether their responses are correct. This chat buffer is recorded and analysed for evidence of peer learning and conceptual understanding. Analysis of this data can help to ascertain whether and when:

1. collaborative discussion / peer instruction is occurring
2. collaborative discussion is helping with understanding
3. to best facilitate effective online collaborative learning online

Student performance on each quiz gives an indication of their level of understanding of the concept prior to the chat. Their post-chat responses and their responses to the related mid-semester questions can be used to ascertain learning gains for those who did the chat versus those who did not participate. Together these measures will give qualitative and quantitative understanding of the gains in learning as a result of the MOOCchat discussions. 

Students who select this research project may focus on the design and running of experiments to determine the effectiveness of the software in improving student engagement and performance of learning or can choose to improve the overall design of the software system to allow for administrator control or improvements to the user interface.</details><details><summary>Further Information:</summary>https://www.elipse.uq.edu.au/home</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Privacy Preserving Roadmap Planning [NEW]</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Surya Singh</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>14</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>1</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>AI/Cognitive ScienceComputational ScienceInformation SystemsRoboticsSignal and Image ProcessingSoftware</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>METR4202 or COMS4507</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,BE/ME,BInfTech(Hons),BMultMedDes(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc,MInfTech,MIDes students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>This project considers the application of homomorphic cryptosystems (e.g., ElGamal or Paillier) in motion and route planning.   (co supervised by A. Prof. Marius Portmann). 

Distributed (cloud) motion/route planning (e.g., Google Maps, Telerobotic medical operations) typically involves sharing initial and final states (origin and destination in the case of Google Maps) and thus may "leak" user privacy.    This problem also appears in various contexts, such as in Privacy preserving route planning [1-2].  The structure of motion planning problems [3] may well be suited to leverage results from this domain, particularly for cases where one needs to computing distance functions of routes and/or assess traffic (group-sourced) information in a private manner.

Note: This is separate from the process of communicating securely to the remote "solver" (i.e., Tor/Orbot, SSL, etc.)

The initial focus would be on supporting the query-based ​selection of codes for distinct aggregation categories. This project would use the new HL7 FHIR standard, and exploit CSIRO’s Ontoserver technology that underpins the National Clinical Terminology Service recently launched by the Australian Digital Health Agency. It carries the opportunity to influence and improve the FHIR standard itself. For extra credit, the student will also support visualisation of aggregate patient data using the SMART on FHIR.

Rather than creating form-based editors for each resource type by hand, it would be preferable to be able to generate, or partially generate, an editor based on the definition of the structure of the resource type: what attributes it has, their types and allowable values, etc. This might be done as a mapping directly to web technologies (HTML, Angular, etc), or via an intermediate structure such as FHIR Questionnaires. The mappings would need to be flexible, to allow for variability such as the grouping of related attribute fields, or choice of what widget (e.g. radio button vs dropdown vs text field) is used for each attribute).</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Programming Assessment Tool</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Richard Thomas</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>3</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Systems and Software Engineering Group</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>2</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>Software</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>Strong programming skills, some web development skill, COMP4403 would be helpful but not required</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6,8 over one or two semesters for BE,BInfTech(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>You will build a tool to provide semi-automated assessment of programs. The tool would be used by students for self-assessment to determine if they have met requirements for a programming assignment. It would also be used by tutors and lecturers to assist in the marking process.

The tool would assess a program by executing it against a set of tests and also by analysing the structure of the source code. It would report back on tests passed or failed. It would also report back on potential issues with the code's structure as checked against a set of criteria. The output would be able to be adjusted based on what details a course coordinator wanted students to see.

It is expected that the project would use existing tools, to provide as much functionality as possible in a limited time. The project should be designed so that the source code analysis and testing components can be replaced to accommodate different programming languages and testing tools (e.g. Python and Java). The initial version of the tool would target a single language. The tool would also collect data on student usage. The tool would also use MoSS to perform plagiarism detection.</details></details></p></hr><hr><p><details><summary>Automated Testing for libGDX</summary><details><summary>Supervisor:</summary>Richard Thomas</details><details><summary>Project ID:</summary>4</details><details><summary>Research Group:</summary>Systems and Software Engineering Group</details><details><summary>Max. students:</summary>2</details><details><summary>Discipline(s):</summary>Computer SystemsHuman Computer InteractionSoftware</details><details><summary>Students signed up:</summary>0</details><details><summary>Prerequisite(s):</summary>DECO2800</details><details><summary>Project Type(s):</summary>#4,6 over one or two semesters for BE,BE/ME,BInfTech(Hons),MEngSc,MCompSc,MInfTech students</details><details><summary>Description:</summary>libGDX is a popular cross-platform tool for creating games.
